# LREC 2022 Gender Bias Submission

This repository contains test sets, namely "Spanish 3" and "Serbian", used in the paper _Leveraging Pre-trained Language Models for Gender Debiasing_ to evaluate the BERT based approach to generate gender variants. 
The corpus will also be available to freely download from the "Share your LRs" initiative by LREC. 

1. Spanish3.zip - This zip file contains three text files desceibed as follows:
	1. Spanish3.test - This is the "Spanish 3" test set that is mentioned in the paper. This is one of the test sets used to evaluate our approach on. These sentences are extracted from the OpenSubtitles corpus _(J ̈org Tiedemann. (2012). Parallel Data, Tools and Interfaces in OPUS. European Language Resources Association (ELRA)._
	2. Spanish3.reference - These are the correct gender variants of the "Spanish 3" test that the generated variants (using our approach) are compared to.
	3. Spanish3.tags - This file contains tags to identify whether a given sentence is regenderable or neutral.

2. Serbian.zip - This zip file contains three text files desceibed as follows:
	1. Serbian.test - This is the "Serbian" test set that is mentioned in the paper. This is one of the test sets used to evaluate our approach on. These sentences are extracted from the OpenSubtitles corpus _(J ̈org Tiedemann. (2012). Parallel Data, Tools and Interfaces in OPUS. European Language Resources Association (ELRA)._
	2. Serbian.reference - These are the correct gender variants of the "Serbian" test that the generated variants (using our approach) are compared to.
	3. Serbian.tags - This file contains tags to identify whether a given sentence is regenderable or neutral.
